#MyFirstFinanceDashboard
This is a Finance Dashboard Based on codebasics (youtube) Personal Finance Project reimagined by me.
The data contains personnel Finance Metrics like Salary ,Expenses and Savings b/w 2018- 2021 spreading on different components like Household, Mutual funds etc...

In this I used #PowerQuery for data transformations and cleaning techniques such as Unpivoting then used #DAX measures to Calculate several key metrices namely Total Income, Total Saving, Total Expenses Cumulative Net Worth and many others.

For the Analysis and Visualization part I used visuals like Slicers for different year and month view of key Metrices, Table Chart for an Overview , Clustered Bar Chart for comparison of different components and Cards for Important KPIs.
