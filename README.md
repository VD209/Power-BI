THE GREAT INDIAN FOREST STORY
This is My Analysis on forest cover of India. 
In this I used 2011 forest data from Government websites to get insights on Forest land in India. 
In this I used power Query, power pivot and Power Bi to analyse and transform data to visualize it using bar graphs and pie charts to make it easy for everyone to understand. 
Also, I will be adding new data time to time to make it more up to date.
This one page report is a personnel project.
